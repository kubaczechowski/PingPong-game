# PingPong-game
Game created in three people team as a school project. The aim was to create a version of the classic game “Pong”. Game incudes two game modes, vs. Computer and vs. Player. In each of them a user is supposed to bounce the ball using a paddle and prevent a ball from hitting a floor (in single player mode) or prevent the ball from hitting the space behind the paddle (in mulit player mode)
